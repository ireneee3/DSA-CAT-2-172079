# Question 1:Rules of Big O Notation in Algorithm Analysis
The Big O Notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm majorly specifying on the runtime of an algorithm as well as  how the memory requirements grow as the input size increases.Here are some rules:

## Rules of Big O Notation

### 1. Worst-Case Scenario
Big O focuses on the most amount of time and space that an algorithm might need,assuming the worst possible inout.
- **Example**: Searching an array for an element ay take O(n) time. in the worst cas,in the case where the element is at the end or missingThis linear growth reflects on the upper bound.

### 2. Drop Constants
Constants coefficients are ignored because they don’t affect the algorithm's grwoth rate in general.
- **Example**: If an algorithm  was to take 2n steps (e.g., two array traversals),  the "2" is dropped  and called  O(n).
### 3. Drop Lower-Order Terms
As the algorithm's input size increases,only the highes-order term becomes important.
- **Example**: Bubble Sort might have n² comparisons and n swaps, but we remove the n term, leaving O(n²) because the quadratic part is dominant.

### 4. Different Input Variables Rule
When an algorithm handles multiple inputs (e.g., sizes a and b), their contributions are put together separately.
- **Example**: Merging two arrays of sizes a and b takes O(a + b) time, showing how time complecity is affected by each input
