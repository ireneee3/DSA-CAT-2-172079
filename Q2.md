# Question 2: Arrays vs Linked Lists

Arrays and linked lists are  data structures that store collections of elements.They have several differneces.

## Memory Allocation
- **Arrays**:  
  - Arrays store elements in **contiguous memory locations**.All elements are stored next to each other in memory.  
 
- **Linked Lists**:  
  - Linked lists store elements in **non-contiguous memory locations**. Each element or node  contains the data and a pointer to the next node.  
  - Memory is allocated dynamically per node meaning the memory for each node is allocated individually as the elements  are  added to the lists.
  

## Performance
- **Arrays**:  
  - **Access Time**0(1): Arras provide constant-time access to elements using indices.
  - **Search Time**: Searching an unsorted array takes **O(n)** (linear time) seeing as each element may need t be checked throroughly while looking for a sorted array.
  -**Memory Usage**:Arrays are more efficient in memory usage for storing the actual data but may waste memory if the allocated size is larger than needed.

- **Linked Lists**:  
  - **Access Time**: Accessing an element requires traversing from the head, taking **O(n)** time.  
  - **Search Time**: Like arrays, searching takes **O(n)**.  
  -**Memory Usage**:Linked lists are less efficient with local memeory because there is an additional overhead of storing references.

## Insertion and Deletion Operations
- **Arrays**:  
  - **Insertion at the Beginning or Middle**:**O(n)** This happens because all subsequent elements must shift to make space.  
  - **Insertion at the End**:**0(1)**If the array has available space, O(n) if resizing is required. 
  - If full (fixed-size), insertion isn’t possible without resizing; for dynamic arrays, resizing is **O(n)** but amortized to **O(1)**.  
  - **Deletion from end****O(1)** operation.  
 

- **Linked Lists**:  
  - **Insertion at the Beginning**: Insertion or deletion is **O(1)**, updating only the head pointer and a few references.  
  - **Insertion At the End**: Without a tail pointer, it’s **O(n)** due to traversal.  
 With a tail pointer, insertion is **O(1)**; deletion may still be **O(n)** unless doubly linked.  
  - **At a Specific Position**:  
    - Finding the position takes **O(n)**.  
    - Once found, insertion/deletion is **O(1)** via pointer updates.
